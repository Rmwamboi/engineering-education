## Building native apps on android using JavaScript, HTML and CSS -Angular Ionic

The main operating systems on phones are android and IOS. There is an increasing demand for customized apps and websites developed to suit businesses, individuals, or even rendering a particular service. Having knowledge of coding through Hyper Text Mark-up Language ([HTML](www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp)), [JavaScript](https://techterms.com/definition/javascript), and Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](https://skillcrush.com/blog/css/)) is beneficial in building your applications. There is an increasing presence of an online community of developers, resource tools, and free software that can be accessed to guide in building these applications.

This article discusses the testing, building, and debugging of native apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also explains the advantages and disadvantages of native apps built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

### An overview of native apps
A native application refers to an operating system designed to be incorporated into a specific platform or gadget. Native software or information structures are delineated to operate only on particular software. From a high-tech perspective, native codes refer to encryptions written precisely for a particular processor. 

Native applications are different from cross-platform software since the latter are functional from several operating networks and computer desktop and laptop architectures. Since native apps are constructed for use on specific gadgets and their operating systems, they can employ gadget-specific hardware and software. These native apps can benefit from the current technological advancements and produce optimized production levels.

One of the recent technological advancements that native apps can benefit from is the Global Positioning System ([GPS](https://mobileappstudio.wordpress.com/tag/global-positioning-system/)). This is advantageous to the native applications since the web applications or gadget cloud applications cannot benefit from these advancements.

### The functionality of JavaScript, HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets in native applications
JavaScript refers to a programming language that incorporates texts on the user and server ends, permitting the creation of interactive web pages. It is used in designing web and gadget applications, constructing web servers, and coming up with server applications and game creation. 

JavaScript is preferred over other programming languages. It is the only native one to the network search engine. It requires a minimum threshold to begin, and it is the most popular and frequently used language. JavaScript frameworks are properly-equipped for device application development since they can be employed in various mobile platforms such as IOS and Windows. JavaScript works in native apps by inserting a JavaScript code within a basic web page, which encodes the JS encryption it recognizes in the web page and runs it. The search engine contains an inbuilt interpreter, which decodes the programming language. 

A basic JavaScript framework comprises of a baseline compiler employed in JS source encryption compilation into an intermediate exhibition, also termed the [bytecode](https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-bytecode/). The interpreter is fed with this code, and it changes it to an automated code, which can be executed on the computer hardware.

HTML is an acronym for the programming code Hypertext Markup Language. It is incorporated in the development of websites and their contents. Web page contents could be constructed among a group of paragraphs, a set of bulleted ideas, and information tables. The Hypertext Markup Language comprises several aspects which can be employed in the enclosure of wrapping distinct sections of the content for it to turn out or perform in a specific way. The anatomy of an HTML document bears a series of elements, each having a different purpose for incorporation.

The standard version of HTML is used to develop native apps. It works by documenting brief codes into a text document by developing the native application. These short encryptions are termed as the [tags](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_html.asp). The document is then saved in the form of an HTML file and perceived via a browser. Consequently, the search engine reads and converts the document into a comprehendible format and renders the programmer's intended application.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) refers to a language presented in a stylesheet. It is documented with the objective of a description of texts written in HTML or XML. This language defines the techniques of rendering elements on display screens, audio form, and paper, among other media. The open web consists of several key languages, and CSS is categorized among these core languages.

CSS works in native apps traditionally and some in improved means. Some of the traditional working techniques of CSS include using the class names which bear the most sense in the context of every element. Additionally, one can also co-locate the encryption interlinked to each element with the [TypeScript](https://2ality.com/2020/04/webpack-typescript.html#) and HTML code. One of CSS's most recent working techniques is defining the designs that align with the template. This definition can be done by setting the design attribute within the component metadata. This design character takes a series of strings having the CSS code.

### Building native apps using JavaScript, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets
There are several techniques for building native applications. Recently coders developed software to assist in establishing native android applications. Some of these software include [Phone Gap and Apache Cordova](https://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-phonegap-and-cordova). 

However, these applications require knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These software work by first prompting the user to install them on the gadgets. Consequently, the user must construct the native application from the installed software while incorporating knowledge of the programming languages; JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Some developers also build web applications and transform them into native android-built apps using the JS programming language and the HTML code deployed in specific software.

While employing these programming languages in building native applications, the user is first required to develop a relevant framework that will guide the app development process. Designing native android applications without establishing relevant frameworks renders them obsolete. Additionally, building native android applications requires the creation of a [local WebView wrapper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59589983/hybrid-app-native-webview-wrapper-vs-ionic-approach). 

To access local hardware and software through the local wrapper, the user needs to document a JavaScript Adapter. Additionally, the user is required to define custom techniques in the JS Adapter. These techniques lead to an operation in Java that has permitted access to the local operating system facility. Software including Phone Gap follow these techniques, but they have prior written JS operations for the user. This function saves the user the coding process, which could be costly and time-consuming.

### Testing of native applications
Testing native apps requires angular fundamentals, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS insights. One of the testing techniques for these angular applications is set up testing. The [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) uploads and installs all relevant resources required for assessing a native application using the Jasmine test framework. The established project with the CLI is instantly test-ready by running the `ng test` prompt. The app is constructed after the `ng test`, and the Karma test runner is initiated. Chrome browsers also illustrates the output, and several users find this display easily readable. Other techniques of unit testing Angular apps are employed with other assessment libraries and runners. Every library possesses a distinct installation process, layout, and syntax. Similarly, each runner has a different configuration, syntax, and installation process.

### Troubleshooting of bugs in built apps
Troubleshooting entails problem-solving to mend failed tools and processes on automatic systems. It comprises the procedure of identifying faults in the standard functionality of a system resulting from the failure. Native bugs are only exhibited on Android or IOS gadgets. 

One of the techniques employed in troubleshooting problems in android native apps is clearing the cache and attempting to restart. Cache refers to a storage area where constantly accessed information is stored. The swiftest storage technique available to the app coder is the operating system. Resetting the application is another technique that could be incorporated in solving issues inbuilt apps. 

Downgrading the application could as well assist in troubleshooting bugs in native apps. This factor implies that the user will be prompted to install a lower version of the application rather than using the present upgraded application. Lastly, performing a factory reset could help solve built native app bugs. However, this option is proposed to users who face software issues on various apps since it results in complete data loss.

### Advantages and disadvantages of native apps built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS

#### Pros
- One of the most distinct pros of native apps is leveraging integral components of the native system to provide the best presentation and improved user experience, and increased performance levels. 
- Native applications are also operational in offline settings, unlike other web applications, which require an internet connection to function. Despite this factor being advantageous, it bears the trade-off of directing the construction of several application forms to support the various gadget platforms and their diverse versions in a highly partitioned sphere. 
- Native applications have better performance levels than web applications, specifically in games. These apps also have complete access to all detectors, hardware, and popups from a device.
- Additionally, native applications are dispersed through a public app location such as Google Play. The icon is instantly displayed on the gadget's home screen upon installation, permitting easier access.

#### Cons
- Native applications are disadvantageous as they experience a scarcity of coders. 
- Additionally, it is expensive to construct several apps while dedicating one for every interface. It is also costly and time-consuming to manage the distinct code foundations for every interface. 
- Native applications have versions through several interface platforms, which could get out of synchrony since the construction timeframes differ. The application distribution speed is also slow as the duration intended to check every app store's approval is lengthy. 
- Constantly upgraded versions in the platforms result in several challenges to the app coders for assessing and addressing compatibility problems.
