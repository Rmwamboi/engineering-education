**Building-Native-Apps-on-Android-using-JavaScript-HTML-and-CSS â€“ Angular-ionic**

### Introduction.

The main operating systems on phones are android and IOS. There is an increasing demand of customized apps and websites developed to suit businesses, individuals or even rendering a particular service.Having a basic knowledge of coding through Hyper Text Mark-up Language ([HTML](www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp)), [JavaScript](https://techterms.com/definition/javascript) and Cascading Style Sheets ([CSS](https://skillcrush.com/blog/css/)) are beneficial in building your applications. There is an increasing presence of an online community of developers, resource tools and free software that can be accessed in order to guide in the process of building these applications.

A native application refers to an operating system designed to be incorporated in a specific platform or gadget. Native software or information-structures are particularly delineated to only operate on certain application software. From a high-tech perspective, native codes refer to encryptions written precisely for a particular processor. Native applications are different from cross-platform software since the latter are functional from several operating networks and/ or computer desktop and laptop architectures. Since native apps are constructed for use on certain gadgets and their operating systems, they possess the ability to employ gadget-specific hardware and software. These native apps can benefit from the most current technological advancements and produce optimized production levels. One of the recent technological advancements that native apps can benefit from is the Global Positioning System ([GPS](https://mobileappstudio.wordpress.com/tag/global-positioning-system/)). This is advantageous to the native applications since the web applications or gadget cloud applications cannot benefit from these advancements.

### Functionality of JavaScript, HTML, and Cascading Style Sheets in Native Applications.


JavaScript refers to a programming language that incorporates texts on the user and server ends permitting the creation of interactive web pages. It is used in the designing of web and gadget applications, construction of web servers and coming up with server applications and game creation. JavaScript is preferred over other programming languages as it is the only native one to the network search engine, it requires a minimum threshold to begin and it is the most popular and frequently used. JavaScript frameworks are properly-equipped to device application development since they can be employed in various mobile platforms such as IOS and Windows. JavaScript works in native apps by inserting a JavaScript code within a basic web page, which in turn encodes the JS encryption it recognizes in the web page and runs it. The search engine contains an inbuilt interpreter which is used to decode the programming language. A basic JavaScript framework comprises of a baseline compiler that is employed in JS source encryption compilation into to an intermediate exhibition, also termed the [bytecode](https://www.edureka.co/blog/java-bytecode/). The interpreter is fed with this code and it changes it to automated code which can be executed on the computer hardware.

HTML is an acronym for the programming code Hypertext Markup Language. It is incorporated in the development of websites and their contents. The web page contents could be constructed among a group of paragraphs, a set of bulleted ideas and information tables. The Hypertext Markup Language comprises several aspects which can be employed in enclosure of wrapping distinct sections of the content for it to turn out or perform in a specific way. The anatomy of a HTML document bears a series of elements, each having a different purpose for incorporation.

The standard version of HTML can be used in development of native apps. It works by documenting brief codes into a text document by the writer developing the native application. These short encryptions are termed as the [tags](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/tag_html.asp). The document is then saved in the form of a html file and perceived via a browser. Consequently, the search engine reads and converts the document into a comprehendible form and renders the programmer's intended application.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) refers to a language presented in stylesheet. It is documented with the objective of description of texts written in HTML or XML. This language defines the techniques of rendering elements on display screens, in audio form and paper, among other media. The open web consists of several key languages and CSS is categorized among these core languages.

CSS works in native apps traditionally and some in improved means. Some of the traditional working techniques of CSS include using of the class names which bear the most sense in the context of every element. Additionally, one can also co-locate the encryption interlinked to each element with the [TypeScript](https://2ality.com/2020/04/webpack-typescript.html#) and HTML code. One of the most recent working techniques of CSS is defining the designs that align with the template. This definition can be done by setting the design attribute within the component metadata. This design character takes a series of strings having the CSS code.

### Building Native Apps Using JavaScript, HTML and Cascading Style Sheets.

There are several techniques of building native applications. Recently coders have developed software to assist in establishment of native android applications. Some of these softwares include [Phone Gap and Apache Cordova](https://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-phonegap-and-cordova). However, these applications require knowledge on JavaScript, HTML and CSS. These software work by prompting the user to install them on the gadgets first. Consequently, the user is required to construct the native application from the installed software while incorporating knowledge on the programming languages; JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Some recent developers also construct web applications and transform them into native android-built apps using the JS programming language and the HTML code deployed in specific software.

While employing these programming languages in building native applications, the user is first required to come up with a relevant framework that will guide the app construction process. Designing native android applications without establishing relevant frameworks renders them obsolete. Additionally, building native android applications requires creation of a [local WebView wrapper](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59589983/hybrid-app-native-webview-wrapper-vs-ionic-approach). To access local hardware and software through the local wrapper requires the user to document a JavaScript Adapter. Additionally, the user is required to define custom techniques in the JS Adapter. These techniques lead to an operation in java which has permitted access to the local operating system facility. Software including Phone Gap follow these techniques but they have prior written JS operations for the user. This function saves the user the coding process which could be costly and very time-consuming.

### Testing of Built Native Applications.

Testing of native apps requires insights on angular fundamentals, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. One of the testing techniques for these angular applications is set up testing. The [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) uploads and installs all needs required for assessing a native application using the Jasmine test framework. The established project with the CLI is instantly test-ready by running of the ng test prompt. From the ng test, the app is constructed and the Karma test runner is initiated. Chrome browsers also illustrate the output and several users find this display easily readable. Other techniques of unit testing Angular apps are employed with other assessment libraries and runners. Every library possesses a distinct installation process, layout and syntax. Similarly, each runner has a different configuration, syntax and installation process.

### Troubleshooting of Bugs in Built Apps.

Troubleshooting entails problem solving to mend failed tools and processes on automatic machinery or systems. It comprises the procedure of identifying faults in the normal functionality of a system resulting from failure. Native bugs are only exhibited on Android or IOS gadgets. One of the techniques employed in troubleshooting problems in android native apps is clearing the cache and attempting to restart. Cache refers to a storage area where information that is accessed constantly is stored. The swiftest storage technique available to the app coder is the operating system. Resetting the application is another technique that could be incorporated in solving issues in built apps. Downgrading the application could as well assist in troubleshooting bugs in built native apps. This factor implies that the user will be prompted to install a lower version of the application, rather than using the present upgraded application. Lastly, performing a factory reset could help in solving built native app bugs. However, this option is proposed to users who face software issues on various apps since it results in complete data loss.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Native Apps Built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Pros

One of the most distinct pros of native apps is leveraging integral components of the native system to provide the best presentation and improved user experience as well as increased performance levels. Native applications are also operational in offline settings, unlike other web applications which require internet connection to function. Despite this factor being advantageous, it bears the trade-off of requiring the construction of several forms of the application to support the various gadget platforms and their diverse versions in a highly partitioned sphere. Native applications have better performance levels than web applications, specifically in games. These apps also have complete access to all detectors, hardware and popups from a device. Additionally, native applications are dispersed through a public app location such as Google Play. Upon installation, the icon is instantly displayed on the gadget's home screen permitting easier access.

## Cons

Native applications are disadvantageous as they experience scarcity of coders. Additionally, it is expensive to construct several apps, while dedicating one for every interface. It is also costly and time-consuming to manage the distinct code foundations for every interface. Native applications have versions through several interface platforms which could get out of synchrony since the construction timeframes differ. The application distribution speed is also slow as the duration intended to check every app store's approval is lengthy. Constant upgraded versions in the platforms result in several challenges to the app coders for in assessment and addressing of compatibility problems.
